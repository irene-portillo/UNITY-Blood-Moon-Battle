# Blood Moon Battle [FINAL PROJECT] - Game Design 

FINAL PROJECT FOR 53-230 ****
--------------------------------

// PROJECT DESCRIPTION //

The game is meant to be a 2D story-based RPG (Iâ€™m guessing since you assume the role of a character with a storyline) where the player must go on a journey to retrieve an item through fighting an enemy. It is beat-able by obtaining the item. The player's challenge is to steal back a moon amulet as their land is bound to darkness without it. To regain it, has to go through mysterious cavern where it encounters evil entities.
